        <p>
            Hattrick is an online soccer strategy game where you build and manage an imaginary soccer team for a long-term run. </br>  
            You receive a pre-populated team of mostly junk players and lead that team to the top division of your country.</br> 
            To do so, you need to do the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Establish a good coaching network</li>
                <li>Create a youth academy</li> 
                <li>Maintain a stadium that will generate enough revenue</li>
                <li>Intelligent purchasing and selling of players in the transfer market.</li>
            </ol>
